<span>About me</span>
<p>I was passionate about design and art as long as I can remember myself. Since I was diffident and reserved as a child, I always enjoyed the fun of expression by drawing. Time flew when I buried myself in the drawing every weekend. Over time, sketch has made me more sensitive to colors and shapes, which laid foundations for my future study of design. First art classes I started when I was seven years old, in the same age I decided to be an illustrator. At the drawing academy, I fell in love with the visual communication design and changed my plans accordingly.
</p>
<p> I started my university as visual communication design student four years ago at the University of Alberta, where I really started to do my designs.</p>
<p>I am passionate about using visual communication to create better user experiences, and I have worked on projects for such clients as Xinchang Ocean City mall, Mizu women brand.</p>
<p>To me, design is open to everyone. Everybody can take part in design or comment design. Both the result and the process of a design are valuable. I believe that a good design is based on a good designer. As what my family always tell me, kindness should be a prime concern.
